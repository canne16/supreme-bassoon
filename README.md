# Supreme Bassoon

**Supreme Bassoon** is a Python command-line tool for image interpolation and scaling. The project implements several interpolation methods to upscale images and visualize the results. It’s built using popular libraries such as NumPy, Pillow, Matplotlib, and Click.

## Overview

This tool provides an easy way to experiment with different image interpolation techniques. It supports the following methods:

- **Nearest Neighbor (nn):** A simple method that assigns each new pixel the value of the closest original pixel.
- **Bilinear (bl):** A method that uses a weighted average of the four nearest pixels.
- **Piecewise Linear (pw):** Interpolates first along the rows and then along the columns using linear interpolation.
- **L2 Optimal (l2):** Uses Fourier zero-padding to upscale images optimally in an L2 sense (requires an integer scaling factor).

The tool accepts an image file as input, performs the chosen interpolation, and displays both the original and upscaled images side by side. Optionally, you can also save the upscaled image.

## Features

- **Multiple interpolation methods:** Easily switch between different upscaling techniques.
- **Visualization:** View a side-by-side comparison of the original and interpolated images.
- **Command-line interface:** Simple and flexible CLI powered by Click.
- **Python packaging:** Managed using Poetry for dependency handling and packaging.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/)

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/canne16/supreme-bassoon.git
cd supreme-bassoon
```

Install the dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):

```bash
poetry install
```

Alternatively, if you prefer using pip, you can create a virtual environment and install the requirements manually (ensure you install the packages listed above).

## Usage

You can run the tool directly via the command line. For example, to upscale an image using the nearest neighbor method:

```bash
poetry run python -m supreme_bassoon path/to/your/image.jpg --method nn --scale 2 --verbose --save
```

### Command Options

- `file`: The input image file.
- `-m, --method`: Interpolation method to use. Options are:
  - `nn` – Nearest Neighbor (default)
  - `bl` – Bilinear
  - `pw` – Piecewise Linear
  - `l2` – L2 Optimal (requires an integer scale factor)
- `-s, --scale`: Scaling factor (default is 2).
- `-v, --verbose`: Print detailed information about the interpolation process.
- `--save`: Save the upscaled image to the `output/` directory.

## Interpolation Methods

The core functionality is implemented in the `methods.py` module:
- **nearest_neighbor:** Uses a basic copy mechanism from the source image.
- **bilinear_interpolation:** Computes a weighted average of surrounding pixels.
- **piecewise_linear_interpolation:** Performs sequential linear interpolation first vertically then horizontally.
- **l2_optimal_interpolation:** Applies Fourier-based zero-padding for optimal scaling.
